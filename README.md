# OpenSteamClient (C# version, still in heavy development)
A partially open-source Steam frontend for Windows and Linux

# Current development status
Everything below is blockers for release. Lots of stuff that's only documented in my head is also blockers. Lots of code cleanups are due. 
Stuff marked later can wait for after we fix the rest of these things.
Stuff marked future can be done eventually or just completely ignored
Stuff marked rebranch-blocker is required to be solved before replacing the main branch.

## TODO: Future/Never
- [ ] Employ observability at the OSW.Client layer
- [ ] Make managed versions of all interfaces
- In the future, this would allow pure C# instead of needing a dependency on the native client and JITEngine
  - IClientEngine and some bits of init would still be unavoidable
- This requires us to know 100% of the interfaces (and would be a pretty big rewrite)
- [ ] Remove JITEngine in favour of code generation (probably no, but could be good for API consumers that want NativeAOT)
- [ ] Rewrite InterfaceDebugger to follow MVVM
- [ ] Plugin system
  - This'd be useful for making sure our code is high quality and not a mess
  - Could also add support for extra game stores and whatnot
  - Possible plugin types:
    - [ ] Library art provider
    - [ ] App provider
    - [ ] Social provider
    - [ ] Auth provider
    - [ ] Misc UI data provider (protondb, widescreen, etc patches)
    - [ ] Overlay provider
    - [ ] ConCommand provider
    - [ ] Store/Community provider
    - [ ] Mod provider
- [ ] Disabling updates for certain apps
- [ ] Custom SDL lib
  - [ ] Some valve specific code for handling steering wheels etc
- [ ] ConCommand support
- [ ] Download additional depots (example: CS2 workshop tools with proton needs Windows CS2 binaries)
  - Should be doable, just need to improve our hooking systems
- [ ] UI Animations
  - Does avalonia support this?
- [ ] VAC support
  - Basically impossible unless we get a .valvesig from Valve, which is unlikely given the nature of our main exe being the regular dotnet runtime
- [ ] ProtonDB integration
- [ ] Automatic game tweaking
- [ ] External modding sources (like Nexus for Fallout games, r2modman for Lethal Company, etc)
- [ ] Cloud file manager GUI
- [ ] UI sounds
- [ ] Shut off PC when game finishes installing
- [ ] Big picture mode
- [ ] Small mode
- Alternative GUIs
  - [ ] Terminal UI
  - [ ] IMGui reimplementation?
    - Leaving here for community interest.
    - It'd be a lot snappier
    - Not as styleable
    - Apparently doesn't have good accessibility features
    - Does have premade C# bindings though
  - [ ] Rust rewrite
    - "egui" seems pretty cool
      - Can also build for the web
  - [ ] VGUI reimplementation?
    - Could probably very simply just load the OG ui from the cached/ folder, but VGUI_s is 32-bit and we're 64-bit
    - Would need to reimplement the entire UI framework from scratch though
- [ ] Reimplement steamclient.dll/so
- [ ] MacOS
- [ ] Reverse ZipVZ (ValveZip?) format

## Testing
If you decide to test OSC, you should report issues in GitHub issues.
There's also a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Vrk6sZfh9u), where you can discuss OpenSteamClient and related projects. 

# Screenshots
Nothing for now.

# Usage
This is only meant for developers. 
Once this is in a good enough state I will write new install instructions.

# System requirements
## Windows
- Windows 10 tested
### For development
- MSVC
## Linux
### For development
- Arch Linux
- MingW 10.0.0/GCC12 (optional if Windows cross compile not wanted)

# Q&A

## Gah! Why is making this taking such a long time???
There's a single developer (Rosentti) working on every aspect of the rewrite. This alone makes things slow, but also the tremendous workload can cause burnout very easily. 
To combat burnout related to OSC, I sometimes work on other projects and different parts of OSC. 

## Partially open source?
This is a GUI for Valve's own Steam Client binaries like `steamclient.so`, `steamservice.so` and `chromehtml.so`. 
Those binaries are not open source and Valve doesn't officially support 3rd-party usage of these. 
This also means we inherit design choices and potential bugs from these files.
Due to this, we cannot fix everything, such as the client not conforming to the XDG paths specification (although we've limited the pollution to a .steam symlink in your home folder only).

Also, thank you Valve for improving Linux gaming, and making a native Steam Client in the first place.

## What version of Steam's binaries do you use?
The repo includes a copy of all the manifests at `Manifests/steam_client_PLATFORM.vdf`, which shows the version and has download paths for the binaries.
The `file` names point to regular zip files at the various client download addresses like `https://client-update.akamai.steamstatic.com/`, just use `unzip`. GUI tools don't seem to work.
`zipvz` seems to be some sort of proprietary zip format, which we haven't reversed.

## The client crashes a lot or doesn't start
Delete `~/.local/share/OpenSteam` and try again. Also check that you have a PC that meets the requirements for Steam officially.
Also, run OpenSteamClient from the terminal and post the logs in a Github issue clearly describing your situation.
