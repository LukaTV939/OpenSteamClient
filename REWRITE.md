# TODO for huge rewrite
I did a lot of the stuff on this checklist, but then got burned out due to the huge scope. 
Now, do it more smartly and tackle these issues individually, or in SMALL groups, to avoid scope creep and burnout.
- [x] Split DI into a separate package (along with API)
- [x] Split logging into a separate package (along with API)
- [x] OperationProgress, instead of IExtendedProgress
- [ ] Stop using concrete classes everywhere, and switch to interfaces.
- [ ] Use proper DI instead of relying on globals.
- [ ] Fix the app system.
- [ ] Make the app system async.
- [ ] And most importantly: Fix the app system.
- [x] Protobuf marshalling without IntPtr arguments
- [x] SharedConnection needs rework (segfaults when exiting)
- [x] Something broke in SharedConnection, the app loads library forever. 
- [ ] ProgressWindow doesn't pop up at all
- [ ] OSWUpdater rewrite in C#
  - [ ] Maybe even the dumper. Someday.
- [ ] DLL that houses the localization files, so it can be used anywhere, by anyone to get proper error and enum strings.
- [ ] ConCommand system needs rewrite (again)
- [x] Refactor everything to use ILoggerFactory instead of Logger.GetLogger
- [x] The logger looks terrible. Split by newlines.
- [ ] Interface debugger is now broken for custom value types.
- [ ] Figure out a way to cross compile Linux->Windows, or run GH actions on Windows too. 
- [ ] Combine OpenSteamClient and OpenSteamworks.Client, or just rewrite the entire thing from scratch with MVVM in mind.
  - [ ] Rewrite the app system.
  - [ ] Rewrite the config system (for UI config).
  - [ ] Rewrite the bootstrapper.
- [ ] NativeAOT support:
  - [x] OpenSteamworks
  - [x] OpenSteamworks.Client
  - [x] OpenSteamworks.KeyValue
  - [x] OpenSteamClient
    - [ ] Fix remaining warnings
    - [ ] Interface debugger
- [ ] Plugin API (not a priority):
  - [ ] Bootstrapper API
  - [ ] InstallManager API
  - [ ] Plugin-level
    - [ ] LibraryArt API
	- [ ] AppManager API
	- [ ] ModManager API
